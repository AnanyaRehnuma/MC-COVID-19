# MC-COVID-19
In this project, we demonstrated how image datasets that
are curated and balanced differently can have influence on
validation accuracy of pre-trained deep learning models,
which can be used as classifiers for COVID-19 detection.
- Performed Pre-processing steps on CT and X-ray Images
found in multiple public datasets(e.g. Image curation, contrast
balance, etc.)
- Trained multiple Deep Learning Models (Convolutional Neural
Network, InceptionV3, ResNet50, DenseNet, VGG16, Unet)
on both original and pre-processed data
• Performed Binary (Healthy and Unhealthy(COVID-19) and
Multi (Healthy, COVID-19 and Pneumonia) Classification on
the datasets
• Evaluated the Deep Learning Models with Precision, Recall, F1
score, Macro and Micro Average
